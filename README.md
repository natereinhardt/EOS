# EOS: Eve Operations Suite

An app to mantain fleet operations within Eve Online.


###THIS APP IS A WORK IN PROGRESS###
I have a plan for it but it will take me a long time to get it there. The tech stack is new to me and I am learning as I go along. I plan to slowly develop it when I have time. 


Im starting this project from scratch with no generators to hopefully grasp a better understanding of the stack im using. Its going to be far from perfect and I expect to refactor the code base many times as it evolves

###Tech Stack###
- AngularJs
- Express
- Nodejs
- MongoDb

###TO RUN###
Travel to the base directory of this project where you saved it.

- run 'grunt dev' in one console
- run 'mondod'  in a new console to start up your mongo database
-finally: run 'node server' in a new console to start up the application

Now travel to localhost:8080 in your browers and BAM!:metal: It should be all up and running. :+1:
